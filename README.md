## [1] ERD-Entity Relationship Diagram

### ERD - What is an ER diagram?

An Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram is a type of flowchart that illustrates how “entities” such as people, objects or concepts relate to each other within a system. ER Diagrams are most often used to design or debug relational databases.ERDs or ER Models use a defined set of symbols such as rectangles, diamonds, ovals and connecting lines to depict the interconnectedness of entities, relationships and their attributes.

### Cardinality

Defines the numerical attributes of the relationship between two entities or entity sets. The three main cardinal relationships are one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-many.

### Example - Tools
This segment pertains to the tools used in the creation of the example above, which was the ___ site a subscription based site used in the creation of flowcharts, ERD's, etc., though a free trial may be initiated in the instance that both email, password and a username are given.

The link to the site may be found within the references section.

## [2] SQL - DataBase

The SQL Database is essentially a structural layout based around the ERD example and scenario, though it is not fully completed it shows the basis in which what would be done to fully complete the database as the functional areas are integrated but no information fed into the tables, with the table insert fucntion needing duplication and actual information to fill, store and display information in the tables.

This may be found and downloaded in the DataBase repository (this one), for self and own use. I would recommend using notepad++ to edit the code since that is what I used when writing it and then using W3S free SQL database and there tutorial and material on the subject since it is all free of charge and relates to databases and was what was used in the development of the database stored in this repository. Links will be posted below for use and reference.

## DataBase - Generic RPG Example

### Introduction 

This is a documentation of the internal content pertaining to the scenario and design of a database based around an RPG,fantasy styled game. Whilst further design documentation ,the illustrated implementation and testing may be seen in external documentation. This external documentation is avaliable to download in this repositorys file libary.

### Scope

This documentation is intended to be read by those involved in the design, implementation and testing of a data base for a provisional RPG game.  

### Type Conventions

Things that have been discussed in a meeting are presented in this document with no asterisks.

Things that have not been offically agreed on but which are suggested by the author are presented with asterisks, like this (*),being marked as omitted until it has been agreed upon that it may be of use or implemented.

So that I may know if its possible to take on said enemy with my current set up (level/HP/Skills)

• As a User

I would like to see the enemys name 

so I may differentiate said enemys
